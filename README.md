# AI-Powered-Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robot
The **AI-Powered Hand Gesture Controlled Robot** uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures via a webcam, translating them into commands for an ESP32-controlled robot. Integrating AI, IoT, and embedded systems, it enables contactless control for automation and assistive tech, providing hands-on experience in AI-driven robotics.
