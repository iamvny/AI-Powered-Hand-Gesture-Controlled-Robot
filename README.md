Introduction
The AI-Powered Hand Gesture Controlled Robot is an advanced system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, and IoT to enable hands-free, contactless control of a robotic vehicle. By using real-time hand gesture recognition, the system interprets user commands and translates them into movement instructions for a microcontroller-based robot. This innovation is particularly useful in assistive technology, smart automation, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

Working Principle
1. Gesture Recognition Using AI & Computer Vision
A webcam captures real-time video feed of hand gestures.
The OpenCV library processes the image frames to detect and track hand movements.
MediaPipe, a powerful framework by Google, is used for hand landmark detection, allowing the system to recognize different hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, directional pointing).
Python-based AI models classify these gestures and map them to pre-defined robot commands such as:
Forward: Move ahead
Backward: Move in reverse
Left: Turn left
Right: Turn right
Stop: Halt all movement
2. Wireless Communication & Microcontroller Control
Once a gesture is recognized, it is converted into a control signal.
The signal is transmitted via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to an ESP32 microcontroller, a popular IoT-based development board.
The ESP32 processes the received signal and commands a motor driver module (e.g., L298N or L293D) to control the robot’s DC motors, enabling movement.
3. Robotic Movement Execution
The motor driver module regulates the speed and direction of the robot based on input signals from the ESP32.
The robotic vehicle moves accordingly, offering an intuitive and seamless control experience.
